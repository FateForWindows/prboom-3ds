# prboom-3ds

This is a preliminary (but playable) port of the Doom engine to the Nintendo 3DS. It is based on PrBoom v2.5.0.

It is unrelated to [prboom3ds](https://github.com/elhobbs/prboom3ds) by elhobbs and will probably be given a more original name later.

## How to run

- Follow the guide to running 3DS homebrew: [http://smealum.github.io/3ds/](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/)
- Place `prboom-3ds.3dsx` and `prboom-3ds.smdh` on your SD card under the directory **/3ds/prboom-3ds**
- Place `prboom.wad` (in the data directory) and an IWAD (such as `doom.wad` or `doom2.wad`) in the same directory
- Launch prboom-3ds from the Homebrew Launcher

The default controls are: (subject to change pending testing)

- Circle pad or touch screen to move
- L/R to strafe
- Y to run, B to fire, A to use/open
- D-pad up/down to cycle weapons
- Select to show the automap
- Start to show the main menu

PWADs and DeHackEd patches can be loaded through the frontend, which also allows you to customize some other pre-game settings (such as starting episode/map, skill level, game mode, etc.).

`prboom.cfg` will be generated at run time; you can edit this manually to change some miscellaneous settings that aren't accessible from the frontend or within the game.

This is also subject to break in weird ways that I don't know about yet. If you see something, say something.

## How to build

- Follow the guide to setting up a 3DS development environment: [http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment)
- Run `make`. The .3dsx and .smdh files will be placed in the project root directory.

## To do

- Add fancy stereoscopic 3D on the top screen
- Minimal touch screen interface for things like selecting weapons or manipulating the automap
- Multiplayer?????
